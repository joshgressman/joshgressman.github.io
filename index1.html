	       <div class="col-md-8"><p>Created Gymsme.com as a one stop shop tool for gyms, health clubs, and local fitness studios. The vision of gymsme.com was to be the "Expedia.com of Fitness." This project was created with WordPress and took upwards of 200 hours. GymsMe provides health club prices, facility and contract information, as well as user review capabilities. The Gymsme.com project was my first website project and it's what started my passion for web development. I loved finding solutions to various coding issues and taking a concept in my head and working it into a functioning webpage.</p></div>

	       <div class="col-md-8"><p>I created the Top 5 Costly Gym Shopping Mistakes eBook for two reasons. First, because the process of fitness service shopping for consumers is stressful and time consuming. It is filled with high pressure sales and vague information. Secondly, I created the eBook as a tool to obtain subscribers and build my email list. The eBook gives valuable information on how to save money, and avoid some of the pitfalls that can happen when joining a gym.</p></div>

	       <div class="col-md-8"><p>Created and managed landing pages specific to monthly marketing campaigns for 5 Fitness 19 locations. The landing pages are used for PPC advertising through Google Adwords and Facebook. The pages ran off WordPress and used various themes and plug-ins. Some months 20+ pages were required to be created in a 24-hour period. Managing these pages allowed me to take what I learned creating Gymsme.com and use it to create landing pages that produced new memberships and an increase in revenue.</p></div>
